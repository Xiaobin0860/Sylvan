 * \brief A node in the ECCO tree (Encyclopaedia of Chinese Chess Openings)
 *
 * The EccoNode class can be used to generate and query a database (a tree) of
 * known chess openings that belong to the Encyclopaedia of Chinese Chess Openings.
 * More about ECCO: http://www.xqbase.com/ecco/ecco_intro.htm
 *
 * The ECCO tree can be generated from a PGN collection or from a binary file
 * that's part of the sylvan library (the default). A node corresponding
 * to a PgnGame can be found by traversing the ECCO tree as new moves are added
 * to the game, or by passing all the moves at once to the find() function.
 *
 * \note The Encyclopaedia of Chinese Chess Openings only applies to games of standard
 * chess that start from the default starting position.
